This is an easy example of how to use the Polar SDK, and the MPAndroidChart library, to realtime plot data from the HR sensor of a Polar smartband.

1. Download and compile the App with Android Studio
2. Enable bluetooth and location services in your mobile phone
3. Load the app in your mobile phone and keep connected to see the log in the console
4. Tap scan option and search in the console for the device ID
5. Set the device id in the sorce code (in the variables definition lines)
6. Reload the app on the phone
7. Click connect
8. Done! If you tap the text label where you can see the Heart Rate value, you will see the realtime plot
